# afd_to_json
Takes a NWS [Forecast Discussion for the Monterey region (MTR)](https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&issuedby=MTR&product=AFD&format=CI&version=1&glossary=1) and converts it to JSON. This will currently only work with forecast discussions from the Monterey office, as each of the 122 weather regions in the US has a slightly different format. [Here is an example of a JSON file generated by this script](http://mattmangels.com/forecast/afd_mtr.json).
