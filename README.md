# afd_to_json
Takes a NWS [Forecast Discussion for the Monterey region (MTR)](https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=NWS&issuedby=MTR&product=AFD&format=CI&version=1&glossary=1) and converts it to JSON. This will currently only work with forecast discussions from the Monterey office, as each of the 122 weather regions in the US has a slightly different format. [Here is an example of a JSON file generated by this script](http://mattmangels.com/forecast/afd_mtr.json).

## Calling the script
Example usage:
```console
python afd_to_json.py output_file.json
```

This will create a file called ```output_file.json```. If you don't pass any arguments to the script the file name will be defined by the variable ```OUTPUT_FILE_NAME``` in the script.
